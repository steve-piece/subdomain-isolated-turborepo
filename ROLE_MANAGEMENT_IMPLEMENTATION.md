# Role Management System Implementation

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing on Local Server

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive user role management system that allows organization owners and admins to update user roles and remove users from organizations with granular permission controls.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Role Update Functionality**

- Update user roles through an intuitive dialog interface
- Dropdown selector with role descriptions
- Available roles: `owner`, `superadmin`, `admin`, `member`, `view-only`
- Automatic JWT refresh after role changes (forces re-login)

### 2. **User Deletion Functionality**

- Two-step confirmation process for user removal
- Warning messages about data loss
- Removes user from organization (user can still log in but won't see this org)
- Cascade handling for related records

### 3. **Permission-Based Access Control**

#### Owner Permissions:

- ✅ Can update any user to any role (including superadmin)
- ✅ Can delete any user (except themselves)
- ✅ Full access to all role management features

#### Superadmin Permissions:

- ✅ Can update users to: admin, member, view-only
- ❌ Cannot promote to superadmin or owner
- ✅ Can delete: member and view-only users
- ❌ Cannot delete: owner, superadmin, or admin users

#### Admin Permissions:

- ✅ Can update users to: member, view-only
- ❌ Cannot assign admin or higher roles
- ✅ Can delete: member and view-only users
- ❌ Cannot delete: admin or higher users

#### Member/View-Only:

- ❌ No role management permissions
- Redirected to dashboard if they try to access team settings

### 4. **Custom Roles Feature Lock**

- Prominent locked feature card on team settings page
- Shows "Available on Business & Enterprise plans"
- Encourages upgrade for advanced permission management
- Links to pricing plans

### 5. **UI Enhancements**

- Role badges with color coding (owner = default, superadmin = secondary, etc.)
- Email display alongside user names
- Shield icon for role indicators
- Hover effects on team member cards
- Action buttons (Update Role, Delete User) appear only for eligible users
- Current user is clearly marked with "(You)"

## File Structure

### Server Actions

```
apps/protected/app/actions/team/
├── update-user-role.ts    # Handles role updates with permission checks
└── delete-user.ts          # Handles user deletion with permission checks
```

### Components

```
apps/protected/components/org-settings/team/
├── team-settings-wrapper.tsx    # Main team management UI
├── update-role-dialog.tsx       # Role update dialog with dropdown
└── delete-user-dialog.tsx       # User deletion with confirmation
```

---

## Permission Logic

### Update Role Checks

```typescript
// Owner: No restrictions
// Superadmin:
- Cannot promote to superadmin or owner
- Cannot modify owners or other superadmins
// Admin:
- Can only modify member and view-only users
- Can only assign member or view-only roles
```

### Delete User Checks

```typescript
// Owner: Can delete anyone (except self)
// Superadmin: Can delete below admin level
// Admin: Can only delete member and view-only users
// Self-deletion is always blocked
```

---

## Security Features

1. **JWT Refresh on Role Change**
   - Updates `force_logout_after` timestamp on user profile
   - Updates `permissions_updated_at` on organization
   - User must re-login to receive new permissions

2. **Server-Side Validation**
   - All permission checks done server-side
   - Client UI reflects permissions but doesn't enforce them
   - Database-level constraints ensure data integrity

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All role changes trigger cache revalidation
   - Paths revalidated: `/org-settings/team`, `/admin`, `/dashboard`

---

## Database Tables Involved

### `user_profiles`

- Columns: `user_id`, `org_id`, `role`, `email`, `full_name`, `force_logout_after`
- Role changes update the `role` and `force_logout_after` columns

### `organizations`

- Column: `permissions_updated_at`
- Updated when any user role changes in the org

---

## Testing Instructions

### Local Development Testing

1. **Start the local server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev --filter=protected
   ```

2. **Access the local app:**

   ```
   http://acme.localhost:3003
   ```

3. **Test with different user roles:**

   **Owner Account:**
   - Email: steven@hormonefitness.com
   - Password: !@Ml3g3nddd
   - Should see all role management buttons

   **Member Account:**
   - Email: hormonefitnessai@gmail.com
   - Password: !@Ml3g3nd
   - Should be redirected from team settings page

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Owner Updates Member to Admin

1. Log in as owner
2. Navigate to `/org-settings/team`
3. Click update role button for member user
4. Select "admin" from dropdown
5. Confirm update
6. User should receive success toast
7. Member user will need to re-login

#### Scenario 2: Admin Tries to Update Another Admin

1. Log in as admin user
2. Navigate to `/org-settings/team`
3. Admin users should NOT see update/delete buttons for other admin users
4. This is enforced both client-side (UI) and server-side (action)

#### Scenario 3: Superadmin Deletes Member

1. Log in as superadmin
2. Navigate to `/org-settings/team`
3. Click delete button for member user
4. Confirm in first dialog
5. Confirm again in alert dialog
6. User should be removed from organization

#### Scenario 4: Member Access Denied

1. Log in as member
2. Try to access `/org-settings/team`
3. Should be redirected to `/dashboard?error=unauthorized`
4. No team management access
