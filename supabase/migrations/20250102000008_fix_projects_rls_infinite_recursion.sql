-- ============================================================================
-- Fix Infinite Recursion in Projects RLS Policies
-- ============================================================================
-- Description: Fixes infinite recursion when querying projects with permissions
-- Root Cause: 
--   - projects SELECT policy queries project_permissions table
--   - project_permissions policies used user_project_access() function
--   - user_project_access() queries projects table again
--   - This creates a circular dependency causing infinite recursion
-- 
-- Solution:
--   - Simplified projects SELECT policy to only check org membership
--   - Removed helper function calls from project_permissions policies
--   - Direct JOINs without circular dependencies
-- 
-- Impact:
--   - Fixes "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation" error
--   - Projects list queries with permissions JOINs now work correctly
--   - Maintains proper security - users only see projects in their org
